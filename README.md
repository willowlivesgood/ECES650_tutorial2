# ECES650_tutorial2
This is the repository for ECES 450/650 Statistical Analysis of Geonomics Tutorial 2: Tree Inference. 

See the file [Tutorial 2.pdf](https://github.com/willowlivesgood/ECES650_tutorial2/blob/main/Tutorial%202.pdf) for a full walkthrough with pictures.
This document will take you through using CIPRES to create a MAFFT sequence alignment, as well as the procedure to build trees with FastTree and RaxML and display them through iToL.

The input file is Haemophilus_influenzae_16S.fasta
The output files are output.mafft, RAxML_bestTree.result, and fastree_result.tree
The final trees can be seen in RaxML_iTOL.png and FastTree_iTOL.png.
